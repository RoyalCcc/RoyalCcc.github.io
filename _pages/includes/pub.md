[**Project**](https://github.com/qhuang18-97/BAMS) \\<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='T_2dlCMAAAAJ'></span></strong>

- A novel belief-map assisted multi-agent system (BAMS) for multi-agent cooperative games.
-	Adopted attention-based inter-agent communication mechanism to overcome partial observation limitation.
-	Improved actor-critic model training convergence speed by up to 68% with the assistance of BAMS.
